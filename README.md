Calculate deltaV for orbit transfer within a central body

---

This project is used to calculate how much deltaV you need to change your orbit within a central body. This idea comes from a game: [KSP](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/) and its realistic [mods](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/190040-rp-1-realistic-progression-one-for-ksp-1123/). It only works for 2-body model with no inclination and using Hohmann Transfer.
